- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tinoky.
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of technical hobby's.
Actually, I spend most of my free time playing and enhencing my DIY CNC, running it under LinuxCNC.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate to any project yet, because I'm still having a lot to lurn about GitHub before that.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
